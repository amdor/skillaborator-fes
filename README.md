# Skillaborator frontend repository

The backend part is located at https://github.com/amdor/skillaborator-bes
The purpose of this application is to provide (yet an other) way to elaborate and improve your skills. </br>
Should you have any questions please contact me at [uitesting93@gmail.com](uitesting93@gmail.com). If you found an issue don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/amdor/skillaborator-fes/issues/new)

## Usage

Running the app locally would require quite some preparation. First of all you need the backend running locally, with a locally setup database. </br>
To run the Angular app first install the dependencies `npm i`, then run in dev mode `npm run start-dev`, and the application will be reachable at `localhost:4200` </br>
For the prod version first build the app `npm run build-prod`, then run the express server `npm start`.
